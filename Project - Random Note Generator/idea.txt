The basis for this idea comes from the Behringer TD-3

Its an analog bass synthesizer. 

Part of its function includes a sequencer. It's somewhat difficult to program but
with some practice, anyone can get it down. 

Another part of its function is being able to clear a pattern, and generate a 
random pattern.

What I don't like about it, is that it doesn't have a selection for key
or mode. It really is a random pattern.

I want to create a console application that would allow me to select 
A) key (i.e., D major, F minor)
B) mode (i.e., Dorian, Lydian)
C) steps (i.e., 4 steps/notes, 5 steps/notes, 6 steps/notes... 16 steps/notes)

 ... I can add more later like (accents, note durations, holds, etc)

/* A key is considered home base
A mode is what notes are going to be played with a key as its base */

With these three selections, the console application shall spit out a certain
number of steps that would result in a melody of some sorts. It would be my job
to interpret the results and program into the Behringer TD-3's sequencer.
This includes, the notes, steps, accents, holds, durations, and octaves.

This shouldn't be too difficult of a application to make.
It involves deepening my knowledge of music theory (in order to code it in) and the
patience to code the solution.

What is the big picture question?
Given a Key, Mode, and Number of Steps, generate a random bassline.

Very hard, but I know that its going to be super cool when its done.
My deadline is this wednesday, but its not feeling realistic.

I really could call off of work at some point to keep working on it


In the meantime, I should watch a youtube video about it if I get the chance.

Should I go back to school?
