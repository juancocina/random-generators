I think this project would definitely harden my knowledge on classes.
As well as my knowledge of music theory.

I think i could create a struct or class called Key 
                                         called Mode.

These two classes would be responsible for holding the information that
would then be chosen at random 

For example, given the option to choose the Key C and its Major representation:
The C Major scale would have its notes chosen at random.

For example, given the chosen options Key A and its Lydian representation:
The A Lydian scale would have its notes choen at random.

The difficult thing here would be storing the notes.
Because they all use the 12 notes that exist.
It's just represented in different manors.

I could definitely just have a vector for each Key/Mode combination, but
that might take up a lot of code space. Retrieval would definitely not be a problem though.

Whereas storing all NOTES in one vector, and having notes eliminated, might save some code
space, that algorithm would be more complicated. 

I don't think theres a very fast solution to generating notes here..

I'm going to watch music theory videos and think about how to store the keys/modes


==========

As of right now I'm a bit worried that i'm going to have to make a 
function for each scale

I know that these random number generators are able to create
a random number between 1-12

But lets say we're using the scale D minor natural: 3 5 6 7 10 11 1 3
At no point do we touch 8, 9, or 2 

So how to we exclude those

Well since [3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 1, 3] is also an array
Pick a number between 0-7 for THIS ARRAY
            0, 1, 2, 3, 4,   5, 6, 7

This still means I have to create an array for each scale though

Well lets get to work

=================

Alright I got the random number generator working as of right now.

I think the goal for the next time I sit down and code is to create the arrays
for each SCALE 
Probably gonna be hashmap since the RNG will print out a number and I can just lookup 
the value at that number in the hashmap...
